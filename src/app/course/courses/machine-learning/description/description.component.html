            <p class="h4">Machine Learning</p>
            <p>Machine Learning is making machines learn to do things to make our lives easier. Through learning ML you are making your lives easier. Movie recommendation systems save your time, data analysis, and visualization make us find effective solutions
                faster and this is used in every sector nowadays even in the health sector, detection systems like plagiarism detection systems are helping researchers, writers, and students. ML is very useful in every sector and recently Ml algorithms
                have reached an accuracy of 96%, we can call it very close to humans. Learning ML is fun you will get to play with data, make things automated with the help of machines(don't start dreaming of machines doing everything for you, you need
                to learn ML to make that happen). Happy Learning Ahead !!!!</p>

                <p>To know about me you can view my <a href="https://www.harshitaramchandani.tech/">portfolio</a>. I am writing non-tech blogs, quotes, etc from the very first year of my engineering; this is my first time for tech blogging. I am learning
                    machine learning currently and personally felt that videos take more time to tell you about something whereas blogs can tell you about things faster (keeping in mind you are interested in the topic). I know you can't get blogs for
                    every topic of machine learning in an arranged manner and having a sufficient amount of content that you need, to make some higher level of projects. So I thought of writing blogs for all important topics of machine learning by gathering
                    content from paid courses and blogs. I will try to cover most of the topics of machine learning and if you want me to add some extra topics you can ping me up on LinkedIn or you can send your request to geeks blogs through our contact
                    page.
